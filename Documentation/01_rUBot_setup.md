# **ROS2 rUBot setup**

The objectives of this section are:
- Setup the robot project in virtual environment for simulation
- Setup the robot project for real control
- Syncronization of the project with github

We have two kind of rbots:
- UB custom made **rUBot_mecanum**
- Commercial **LIMO** robot

## **1. Setup the robot project in virtual environment for simulation**

For **simulation** we will use TheConstruct interface. When working in Laboratory groups, we suggest you:
- One student plays the role of `Director`. This student makes a "Fork" of the Professor's github project.
- The `Director` accept the other students as `Collaborators`
![](./Images/01_Setup/github_collaborators.png)
- Then the `Collaborators` will make a "fork" of the `Director`'s github project.
- The `Collaborators` will be able to update the github `Director`'s project and participate on the project generation

To work on the project (during lab sessions or for homework), each student has to clone the `Director`'s github project in the `TheConstruct working environment`.
- Open your ROS2 Humble environment:  https://app.theconstructsim.com/
- Open your created ROS2_Humble Rosject project
- First time, clone your forked `Director`'s github project
  ```shell
  cd /home/user
  git clone https://github.com/director_username/ROS2_rUBot_mecanum_ws
  cd ROS2_rUBot_mecanum_ws
  colcon build
  ```
  >Successives times, in TheConstruct simulation environment, you can update the project with:
  ```shell
  git pull
  ```
- Add in .bashrc the lines:
  ````shell
  source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
  source /usr/share/colcon_argcomplete/hook/colcon-argcomplete.bash
  source /home/user/ROS2_rUBot_mecanum_ws/install/setup.bash
  cd /home/user/ROS2_rUBot_mecanum_ws
  export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp
  export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=/home/user/ROS2_rUBot_mecanum_ws/src/my_robot_bringup/models:$GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH
  
  #git config --global user.email "xxx@alumnes.ub.edu"
  #git config --global user.name "your_github_username"
  ````
  > Copy and modify the `user.email` and `user.name` accordingly.
- If the compilation process returns warnings on "Deprecated setup tools", proceed with:
  ````shell
  sudo apt install python3-pip
  pip3 list | grep setuptools
  pip3 install setuptools==58.2.0
  ````
- If the compilation process returns wardings on PREFIX_PATH:
  ````shell
  unset COLCON_PREFIX_PATH
  unset AMENT_PREFIX_PATH
  unset CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  cd ~/ROS2_rUBot_mecanum_ws
  rm -rf build/ install/ log/
  source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
  colcon build
  ````
- Open a new terminal to ensure the .bashrc is read again

## **2. Setup the robot project for real control**

The setup process is based on a custom Ubuntu22.04 with the ROS2 Humble environment and the needed packages used on the rUBot project.

A speciffic installation is made for the UB custom rUBot model prototypes.

### **2.1. Setup the rUBot mecanum**

The UB custom rUBot mecanum custom made robot is based on:
- Raspberrypi4 computer onboard
- Custom ROS2 configuration in Ubuntu22.04 server 64bits.


When you power the rUBot mecanum robot, it connects to the wifi `local network: Robotics_UB`:

- Each rUBot has a specific IP address assigned (192.168.1.x4).
- Each computer has a specific IP address assigned (192.168.1.x5).
- From your computer, open a terminal on Desktop and clone the Director's github project:
  ````shell
  cd /home/student/Desktop
  git clone https://github.com/director_github_user/ROS2_rUBot_mecanum_ws.git
  ````
- Open the the project in VScode and verify the .bashrc file has the following lines:
  ````shell
  source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
  source /usr/share/colcon_argcomplete/hook/colcon-argcomplete.bash
  source /home/student/Desktop/ROS2_rUBot_mecanum_ws/install/setup.bash
  cd /home/student/Desktop/ROS2_rUBot_mecanum_ws
  export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=x # change on group number
  export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp
  export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=/home/student/Desktop/ROS2_rUBot_mecanum_ws/src/my_robot_bringup/models:$GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH
  export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb # Best for RVIZ2
  export ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=0 # To allow communication with other computers in the same network
  #git config --global user.email "xxx@alumnes.ub.edu"
  #git config --global user.name "your_github_username"
  ````
  > Modify the `ROS_DOMAIN_ID`, the `user.email` and the `user.name` accordingly.
- Open a new terminal and verify the working nodes from your rUBot_x:
  ````shell
  ros2 node list
  ````
  If the four main nodes are running, you are ready to control the robot.

## **3. Update and syncronize the repository project**

When working in Laboratory groups, we suggest you:

- `Before working on the project`, update the local repository with possible changes in github origin repository
  ````shell
  git pull
  ````
- You can work with your local repository for the speciffic project session
- `Once you have finished and you want to syncronize the changes` you have made and update the github origin repository, type:
  ````shell
  git add .
  git commit -m "Message"
  git push
  ````
- You will have to insert your PAT (Personal Access Token) you have generated
- The `Director`'s github repository has been updated!

To obtain the **PAT** in github follow the instructions:

  - Log in to GitHub
  - Click on your profile picture and select `settings`
  - Select `Developer Settings`
  - Select Access Personal Access Tokens: Choose Tokens (classic)
  - Click Generate new token (classic) and configure it:
    - Add a note to describe the purpose of the token, e.g., "ROS repo sync."
    - Set the expiration (e.g., 30 days, 60 days, or no expiration).
    - Under Scopes, select the permissions required:
      - For repository sync, you usually need: repo (full control of private repositories)
    - Click Generate token
  - Once the token is generated, copy it immediately to a local file in your computer. You won't be able to see it again after leaving the page.
